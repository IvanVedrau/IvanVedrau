# 👋 Hi, I'm Ivan Vedrau

I enjoy coding in **C++** and **C#**, with a strong interest in **game development**, **systems programming**, and problem-solving through code.

I like working close to the engine level, understanding how things work under the hood, and building interactive systems from scratch.
